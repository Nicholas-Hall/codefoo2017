<p>King Kong enjoys climbing the real Empire State Building in New York City to relax after a long shoot, but prefers to spend summers in temperate San Francisco. San Francisco plans to build a to-scale Lincoln Log replica of The Empire State Building as a thank you for King Kongâ€™s many years of B-Movie service. They want you to figure out how many Lincoln Logs it would take. Describe each step in your thought process.</p>

<p>My First thought on This problem is I better break this problem down.</p>
<p>1. I need to find out what parts are available to the lincoln log family.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The short connector is 1.5 in long</li>
        <li>the 2 slot connector is 4.5 in long</li>
        <li>the 3 slot connector is 7.5 in long</li>
        <li>the 4 slot connector is 10.5 in long</li>
    </ul>

<p>2. find the pertinent information on the Empire State Building</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1254ft high</li>
        <li>102 floors</li>
        <li>12.25 ft per floor</li>
        <li>187ft wide or 2244in</li>
        <li>424ft long or 5088in</li>
    </ul>

<p>3. Find a build pattern to fit my problem per floor.</p>
    <p>I belive the only way for this massive undertaking to even get underway is
    to build smaller squares and tie them in.
    <br>

    We can think about rows going vertically and horizontally. Every row will be seperated by 9 inches.
    <br>

    we are going to need:
    <br>
    (187 * 12) / 9 = 249.3 rows
    <br>
    (424 * 12) / 9 = 565.3 rows
    <br>
    249.3 * 567.3 = 141,427.89 long logs
    <br>
    141,427.89 * 2 = 282,855.78
    <br>
    So 282,856 Long longs will give us our foundation. This foundation however only sits 1-1/2in. in height.
    <br>
        <p>The first layer gets to add 3/4in. Every layer after gets to add 3/8.
        Each time we go up now we use three layers. So we can go up 1-1/8in for 282,856 Long logs.</p>


    (1254 * 12) / 9 = 13,376 layers.
    <br>
    13,376 Layers * 282,856 logs = 3,783,481,856 Long logs.</p>
    We need 3,783,481,856 Long logs.
